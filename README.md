- Performed extensive experiments with state-of the-art visual and textual models and then synergistically integrated features of both modalities by utilizing different multimodal fusion approaches.



## System Overview
Figure presents the schematic diagram of our proposed system, which has three major phases: visual feature extractor, textual feature extractor, and multimodal fusion.
